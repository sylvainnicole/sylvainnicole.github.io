I'm working on a project where I have to define the requirements based on discussion with users( like a PO).  I was wondering what is the best way to describe those features: use case or user story.  I have experience writing so I don't mind either one.  

# Use case
Use case are detailed description of the system behavior.  It is based on a main scenario (most probable) and alterative scenarios describing the specific flows of event under different conditions.  This form is useful to describe interaction between the user and the system and the system with other systems.

# User story
This one to describe the functionality the system will provide in user's terms. The user stories are a good unit to create estimates.

# Conclusion
Let's conclude that the use case is probably more oriented towards software engineering practices.  The two methods are, to me, complementary because the describe the system at a different granularity.
